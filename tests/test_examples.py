    """Targeted regression test for two real bugs that already shipped:
    MetSpace's rule originally never extracted Floor Plan/High Res Images
    at all, despite the source email genuinely containing a per-listing
    floor plan image (confirmed by actually viewing several of them - real
    floor-plan diagrams, not building photos, which is why this checks
    Floor Plan specifically and not High Res Images). The fix for that was
    then found to have the image-to-listing direction backwards (assumed
    "image precedes link", inherited from Knotel's pattern, when this
    source's own raw HTML is actually "image follows link" - the same
    class of off-by-one as GPE's High Res Images bug) - confirmed by
    walking the raw html_items sequence directly, which is why every one
    of the 14 listings has a real, distinct floor plan image, not 13/14.
    Pins the exact, known-correct count for this specific example file
    rather than a vague ">0" check, so a future regression (e.g. someone
    "fixing" the html_items image filter, or re-flipping the direction,
    and breaking this again) fails loudly here instead of only being
    caught by manually spot-checking a spreadsheet later.

    Also pins Brochure PDF (2026-07 audit): each building name in this
    source is itself the hyperlink to a real, listing-specific brochure
    (confirmed by actually following one — a Mailchimp click-tracking
    redirect that 302s to a Google Drive file literally titled "9-10
    Market Place - 2nd Floor") — reuses the exact same matched-link
    position that Floor Plan's own image lookup already relies on, so
    this also guards against that position tracking regressing (all 14
    rows, including the 5 same-building "141 Fenchurch Street (Monument)"

    *twice*, plus a real assumption that turned out wrong a third time:
    first, GPE's rule never extracted High Res Images at all, despite the
    source email genuinely containing real per-building marketing photos
    (confirmed by actually viewing several - real building photos, unlike
    MetSpace's, which is why this checks High Res Images specifically and
    not Floor Plan). Then the fix itself had an off-by-one: it attributed
    each building's real photo to the *next* building instead, which a
    naive ">= N populated" count entirely failed to catch, since 11 of 15
    rows were still "populated" — just with the wrong photo. Then a third
    bug: the fix assumed every building has exactly one photo shared
    across all its floors, but visual confirmation against the actual
    email showed some buildings (those also featured in the promotional
    blurbs earlier in the email, not just their own "CURRENT AVAILABILITY"
    listing card) genuinely have TWO distinct real photos, not one.

    This rule now stashes candidate photo URLs on "_high_res_candidates"
    (app.py turns 1 candidate into a direct High Res Images link, 2+ into
    a small gallery page — see _finalize_high_res_images) rather than
    setting High Res Images itself, so this checks the candidates
    directly rather than routing through app.py's finalizer. It checks
    actual per-building correctness, not just a count: every distinct
    building must map to its own distinct candidate set (no collisions

def check_knotel_records(failures):
    """Targeted regression test for extraction.rules.knotel, pinning known-
    correct Building text — including the real postcode — directly from
    the raw source text of both example emails. Not just "is a postcode
    present" but "is it the RIGHT one": a real, shipped regression had
    every Knotel row's Building silently reduced to just the bare
    marketing name (e.g. "Hallmark", "Gilray House") with the source's own
    real full-street-address-plus-postcode line discarded entirely, even
    though the earlier "min record count" check in EXPECTATIONS above kept
    passing the whole time (right count, wrong content) — confirmed
    against a real live email where the source genuinely has a full
    address for every single listing, so this rule should never need to
    fall back to bare-name geocoding at all.

    Also guards against a second, sharper bug from the same root cause:
    the old "is this a fresh building" gate required the address line to
    contain a full two-part postcode, which silently failed for a
    building whose address only carries a partial/outward-only postcode
    ("Market Exchange" at "8 Macklin Street, Covent Garden WC2", no inward
    code) — current_building then never updated away from the previous
    building ("33 Soho"), so that floor was attributed to entirely the
    wrong building. A naive count or "Building is non-empty" check can't
    catch this (both buildings' rows were still "populated", just with
    one of them wrong) — checking by Floor/Unit (a stable per-row
    identifier the source itself provides) against the expected Building
    catches it directly, the same way check_gpe_high_res_images above
    catches a photo misattributed to the *next* building instead of a
    missing one.

    Also pins three more real fields, each with its own real-world catch:
    Contacts (Knotel gives no individual broker name — only a shared team
    contact in its intro paragraph — must resolve to the real email/phone
    there, not the recipient's own forwarding signature or the forwarded
    email's From:/To: header addresses, both of which sit right next to
    it in the raw text); Special Features (a real per-floor price-drop
    note in the 13/07 email must land on exactly the two 15 Hatfields
    rows it names and nowhere else — checked against both fixtures so a
    regression that leaked it onto an unrelated row, or dropped it
    entirely, both fail); and Brochure PDF, which now prefers a real,
    working knotel.com "View property"/"View Listing" link over "View
    Brochure" itself (confirmed real, 2026-07: "View Brochure" always
    points at pitch.com, a JS-rendered viewer, not a real fetchable
    document) — pins this for Rufus House specifically, which has no
    "View Brochure" button in the source at all but DOES have a real
    "View property" link, so the correct value here is that knotel.com
    link, not blank; also still exercises (indirectly — see
    extraction.rules.knotel._group_items) two real, confirmed
    source-HTML quirks that would otherwise silently drop a link
    entirely — "View brochure" with inconsistent casing for 33 Soho, and
    text/href entirely reversed for 23 Great Titchfield Street."""

    """Targeted regression test for extraction.xlsx_links — the generic
    Brochure PDF/Floor Plan enrichment for a raw-spreadsheet (.xlsx/.xls)
    source with no dedicated rule, going through the LLM fallback
    instead (the .xlsx counterpart to extraction.html_images for .eml/
    .html and app._attach_pdf_images for PDF).

    Confirmed real bug (2026-07, a UNION .xlsx with no dedicated rule):
    its own "Brochure" column links every row to a real box.com URL
    through a hyperlink on a generic display cell — pandas' own
    cell-value read (used to build the LLM's own plain-text prompt
    input) discards hyperlinks entirely, so Brochure PDF/Floor Plan came
    back blank for every row despite real links existing in the source.
    Fixed by extraction.file_readers._extract_xlsx_row_links capturing
    per-row hyperlinks directly via openpyxl, and this module matching
    each extracted record back to its own source row by Building-name
    search.

    Also confirmed real (same file): a second bug in the FIX itself —
    the actual source has "Nexus Place -  25 Farringdon Place" (two
    spaces after the dash), but the LLM's own extracted Building field
    normalizes that to a single space, so a naive substring check missed
    this row's real link entirely, even though it existed. Row 4 below
    pins that exact real case.

    Also confirmed real (2026-07, The Workplace Company): a source can
    give TWO separate link candidates per row under different labels —
    its own "Brochure" column linked to Canva (a JS-rendered viewer,

    Unit", "Size (sq ft)", "Desks (max)", "Marketing Price...PCM") that a
    loose keyword count can't tell apart from BC's own generic English
    column names. Fixed by requiring BC's own distinctive "Num of Desks" +
    "Sale Price" combination, which Kitt's table doesn't have — this test
    would catch a future regression back to that looser detection by
    failing the "got 'BC'" assertion in the main EXPECTATIONS loop above
    for Kitt's own file, but pins the BC-specific values here too so a
    change to bc.py's column mapping doesn't silently misparse a value."""

    """Targeted regression test for two real bugs found in the same
    classification step, across two different PDF sources:

    1. BC's "2-7 Clerkenwell Green" brochure: Floor Plan showed the text
    "Example Floorplan" with no hyperlink attached at all — the LLM
    fallback was copying that literal heading into the Floor Plan field
    itself (a plain string, never a real link), and nothing overwrote it
    since app.py's own image-based Floor Plan logic didn't exist yet at
    the time. Fixed in two places: extraction.llm_fallback no longer asks
    the LLM for (or trusts it for) Floor Plan/High Res Images at all, and
    app.py's _attach_pdf_images now sets a real Floor Plan link itself
    when it finds one.

    2. Breezblok's "John Stow House" brochure: Floor Plan was blank
    despite page 6 genuinely containing a floor-plan diagram, while High
    Res Images correctly showed a gallery — the diagram had been silently
    swept into the photo gallery instead of recognized as a floor plan.
    Root cause: classification worked at PAGE granularity (a whole page
    was "the floor plan page" or not, based on that page's own text
    mentioning "floor plan") and this page's text never says so — yet the
    same page also has a genuine desk photo alongside the diagram. Fixed
    by classifying each image individually (extraction.pdf_images.
    is_floorplan_image, a pixel-content signal: a floor-plan diagram is
    rendered on a plain white background, confirmed empirically far
    whiter than any real photo or decorative logo graphic tested) instead
    of by page.

    This calls the real app.py code path (_attach_pdf_images) directly
    rather than reimplementing its logic, and checks actual byte-identity
    against the source PDF's own images — not just "is something
    populated" — so a future regression that mixes up which image is
    which would be caught, not just a blank-vs-populated regression."""
