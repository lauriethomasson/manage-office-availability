    photo gallery, based only on that page's own text) missed this case
    entirely — the page's text never mentioned "floor plan" at all, so
    neither the page nor the diagram on it was ever excluded, and it was
    silently swept into the photo gallery instead of populating Floor
    Plan. See extraction.pdf_images.is_floorplan_page (source-labeled
    text, e.g. BC's own "Example Floorplan" heading) and
    is_floorplan_image (a pixel-content fallback for sources with no such
    label) — either signal marks an image as the floor plan rather than a
    photo. A listing with more than one floor-plan-classified image (not
    seen in any source tested) just uses the first found; there's no
    established gallery convention for Floor Plan the way there is for
    High Res Images.

    A single-record document (e.g. BC's own "2-7 Clerkenwell Green"
    brochure) attaches every real image in the whole PDF to that one
    record, position irrelevant — there's no other record to misattribute
    to. A multi-record document instead uses extraction.pdf_images.
    match_listings_to_images to pair each image to the SPECIFIC listing
    it's positioned next to on the page, not every record whose building
    name happens to appear anywhere on that page — confirmed necessary
    empirically (Crown Estate, 2026-07): its pages routinely hold 2-6
    distinct listings sharing one page (a 2- or 3-column grid), each with
    its own real photos, and the previous whole-page attribution silently
    merged unrelated buildings' photos into one shared gallery whenever a
    page held more than one listing.

    Returns the (storage_key, local_path) pairs for the caller to upload —
    doesn't upload them itself, so a source with many distinct images
    (e.g. Crown Estate's ~15) doesn't add that many synchronous network
    round-trips to this request; see the background-thread upload in
    process() above.

    Deliberately uses pdf_images.scan_pages (a cheap, hash-only pass) plus
    load_page_images/match_listings_to_images (decode one page's images
    at a time, on demand) rather than extract_page_images (which
    materializes every real image for the whole document at once) —
    confirmed via Render's own logs that processing a large PDF (Crown
    Estate, 4.3MB) got the worker SIGKILLed for exceeding the free tier's
    512MB RAM limit. Bounding this to one page's images at a time caps how
    much of a large, photo-heavy document this function can ever hold in
    memory at once, regardless of how many pages/records it has."""

        image's own pixel content or embedded bytes at all, so it can't
        be found by is_floorplan_image no matter how it's tuned. The
