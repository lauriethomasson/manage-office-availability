"""Generic Floor Plan / High Res Images / Brochure PDF enrichment for
.eml/.html sources that have NO dedicated rule-based parser of their own
and go through the LLM fallback instead — the non-PDF counterpart to
extraction.pdf_images/app.py's own _attach_pdf_images (which already
applies generically to any LLM-fallback PDF, gated only by file
extension, not by provider).

Unlike a dedicated rule — written and verified against ONE specific
source's own already-seen HTML structure (e.g. extraction.rules.metspace
trusting mcusercontent.com specifically as MetSpace's own FLOOR PLAN
domain for its usual "WEEKLY AVAILABILITY" template, or
extraction.rules.knotel filtering by its own "X Floor featured image"
alt-text convention) — this has to work reasonably well against an
ARBITRARY, previously-unseen sender's layout, or even a DIFFERENT
template from an already-known sender (confirmed real, 2026-07:
MetSpace's own "Office Of The Week" single-listing spotlight template
goes through this generic path, not its dedicated rule, and — unlike
its usual template — genuinely has BOTH a real content photo and a
floor-plan diagram from the exact same mcusercontent.com domain, so the
domain-based assumption that holds for metspace.py's own template
doesn't hold here). So this favours a defensible, generic heuristic
baseline (alt-text/URL patterns confirmed against a real example, not
assumptions about any one source) over the precision a dedicated rule
can achieve once a provider is seen often enough to justify writing
one — including, for the floor-plan-vs-photo question specifically, an
actual pixel-content check (is_floorplan_image, shared with
extraction.pdf_images) rather than guessing from the URL/alt text
alone, which carries no signal at all for a domain like this one.
