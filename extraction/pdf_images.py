    Confirmed necessary empirically (Crown Estate, 2026-07): this
    source's pages routinely hold 2-6 distinct listings sharing one page
    (a 2-column or 3-column grid), each with its own real photos. The
    previous approach — find every page a building's name appears on,
    then attach every real image found on that whole page — silently
    merged unrelated buildings' photos into one shared gallery (e.g. "7
    Swallow Place" and "Charles House, 5-11 Regent Street", genuinely
    different buildings sharing a page, ending up with the identical
    photo set) whenever a page held more than one listing.

    page_hashes: {page_num: [hash, ...]} from scan_pages — the real,
    non-boilerplate images already known for each page.
    records_by_page: {page_num: [(record_index, building_name, floor_unit), ...]}
    in original extraction order, for records whose find_matching_pages()
    result included that page. floor_unit is that record's own extracted
    "Floor/Unit" value (may be "" if unknown) — see step 2 below for why
    this is needed alongside building_name.

    Returns {record_index: [(page_num, image_bytes, ext, floorplan_url), ...]}
    — page_num included (not just implied by the records_by_page key the
    caller already has) so a caller can still tell which source page a
    given image came from, e.g. for is_floorplan_page's own per-page text
    check. floorplan_url (see _link_uri_for_rect) is the URI of a link
    annotation covering this image's own position, if any — None
    otherwise.

    Algorithm, per page: locate each candidate listing's own heading text
    block (matching _building_candidates the same way find_matching_pages
    does, consuming text blocks in top-to-bottom/left-to-right reading
    order); then assign each real image to the nearest heading directly
    above it that horizontally overlaps its own column — the same
    heading a human reader would associate that image with, not just
    "some heading somewhere on this page." A page with only one listing
    degenerates to the old whole-page behavior automatically, since
    there's only one heading for every image to be nearest to.

    When two or more pending records share byte-identical heading text
    (e.g. two floors of the same building repeat on one page), reading
    order alone doesn't reliably say which LLM-extracted record a given
    occurrence belongs to — confirmed empirically wrong (Crown Estate,
    2026-07): "215-221 Regent Street"'s "3rd Floor South" occurrence sits
    ABOVE its "5th Floor" occurrence on the page, but the LLM's own
    listings array extracted "5th Floor" first — assuming record order
    matches page reading order paired every image with the wrong floor.
    _floor_label_near reads the page's own "Floor | <value>" text printed
    next to each heading occurrence and matches it against each
    candidate record's own floor_unit to disambiguate; falls back to
    reading order (the previous behavior) only when that comes back
    inconclusive, so this is a pure accuracy improvement over the
    single-occurrence and order-agrees-with-layout cases, which were
    already correct."""

    `building_name` (case-insensitive), using whichever candidate tier
    below is the first to match at least one page — never a mix of
    tiers. pages_text is the list of per-page text strings from
    extraction.file_readers' _read_pdf. Relies on these documents' own
    layout convention — a listing's own building name appears as a
    heading on every page describing it — confirmed empirically on the
    Crown Estate example (one building per page or page-pair) and on a
    single-listing brochure (BC's own "2-7 Clerkenwell Green" brochure,
    where the name recurs across all 10 pages); not a guarantee for
    every possible PDF layout.

    Tries the building name as given first, then two narrower fallbacks —
    since an LLM-extracted "Building" often joins a name and its street
    address (e.g. "Linen Hall, 162-168 Regent Street" or "Linen Hall
    162-168 Regent Street") while the source PDF's own text has them as
    separate lines/tokens, sometimes with the name repeated first (a
    two-column page layout printing "LINEN HALL LINEN HALL" before the
    address starts) — which breaks a match on the full joined string
    even after normalizing punctuation. Confirmed empirically on Linen
    Hall/Princes House/Crown House/Maddox House/Kendal House: only the
    bare name portion (stopping at the first digit or comma) reliably
    matches in these cases.
      1. the building name as given
      2. the part before the first comma, if any
      3. the leading run of letters/spaces (stops at the first digit,
         comma, parenthesis, or other punctuation — e.g. "Princes House"
         from both "Princes House 38 Jermyn Street" and "Princes House
         (38 Jermyn Street)", since the LLM's exact punctuation isn't
         deterministic call to call)
    A building name that's mostly numeric (e.g. "1 Vine Street") has no
    useful (3), so it relies on (1)/(2) instead — already confirmed

    Estate, 2026-07): "1 Vine Street, W1" matches one page's own raw text

    the exact same building sits on a page whose own layout doesn't

    records can share byte-identical Building text when the same
    building spans several floors (e.g. Crown Estate's "Princes House,
    38 Jermyn Street" across 4 pages, 2 floors per page) — and
    find_matching_pages naturally returns EVERY one of those pages for
    EVERY one of those records, since it only answers "where does this

    matching page (in a caller building a page->records map) lets several
    pages' images all pile onto whichever records happen to come first,
    while later floors get no images at all — confirmed exactly this
    empirically (Crown Estate, 2026-07): only the first 2 of 7 "Princes
    House" floors ended up with any image, the other 5 got none, even
    though every one of those 4 pages had its own real, distinct photos.

    This lets a caller distribute several same-name records across their
