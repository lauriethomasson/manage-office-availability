    Splits on commas, strips a trailing postcode/city suffix off the
    last segment (repeating if stripping it away entirely reveals
    another one behind it, e.g. a separate "London" segment), then finds
    whichever remaining segment has a house number: the LAST one if it
    has a digit (the common "Name, Street" shape — everything before it
    is the name, kept), else the FIRST one that does (the less common
    case where the real number sits in an earlier segment than a
    trailing non-numbered qualifier — e.g. Classic House's "174-180
    Martha's Buildings, Old St", where "Old St" is dropped but "Classic
    House" is kept since it precedes the digit-bearing segment; or 6
    Maiden Lane's own "Covent Garden" neighbourhood mention with no
    number of its own, where the digit-bearing segment IS the first one,
    so there's nothing before it to keep as a separate name — "6 Maiden
    Lane" alone, "Covent Garden" dropped). Falls back to the fullest
    available text, never blank, if no segment has a digit at all —
    safer than guessing which single word is "the" street name when
    there's no way to confidently tell.

    Deliberately never called from normalize_record itself — Property
    Address 1 there is still set to the unmodified Building, since

    confuses Nominatim, which is exactly what its retry-candidate
