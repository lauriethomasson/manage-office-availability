"""Generic Brochure PDF / Floor Plan enrichment for raw-spreadsheet
(.xlsx/.xls) sources with NO dedicated rule of their own, going through
the LLM fallback instead — the same generic-enrichment role as
extraction.html_images (.eml/.html) and app.py's own _attach_pdf_images
(PDF), but for a source whose real per-row hyperlinks
(extraction.file_readers.row_links) pandas' own cell-value read (used to
build the LLM's own plain-text prompt input) discards entirely.

Confirmed real (2026-07, a UNION .xlsx with no dedicated rule of its
own): its own "Brochure" column links every row to a real box.com
brochure/floor-plan URL through a hyperlink on a generic display cell
("CLICK HERE", "Landlord Brochure", "FLOOR PLAN") — invisible to the
LLM's own text input, so Brochure PDF/Floor Plan came back blank for
every row despite real links existing in the source.

    normalizes whitespace when extracting text. Without this, a plain

    Matches each record to its own source row by Building-name substring
    search against that row's own dumped text (row_text) — the LLM reads
    the sheet top to bottom, so its own extracted Building field should
    appear (up to whitespace differences — see _normalize_for_matching)
    within the row it came from. Each row is consumed at most once, in
    record order, so two records sharing the same building name (e.g.
    two floors of "107 Cannon Street", each with its own Brochure link)
    each get their OWN row's link, not both getting whichever matched
    first.

    Unlike extraction.html_images' own is_brochure_link (which requires
    the link text to actually mention "brochure"/"particulars"/etc —
    appropriate for scanning a whole free-text email body full of
    unrelated links), any non-floorplan link found in a source row here
    is a Brochure PDF candidate regardless of its own display text
    ("CLICK HERE" says nothing on its own) — a per-row hyperlink in a
    spreadsheet's own dedicated link column is reliably one or the
    other; there's no "unrelated link" noise here to filter the way a
    marketing email body has. When a row has more than one such
    candidate (confirmed real, 2026-07 — The Workplace Company gives a
    separate "Brochure" AND "Website" column per listing), the first
    one whose domain ISN'T a known JS-viewer/presentation tool
    (is_low_trust_link_domain) wins, rather than just taking whichever
    column happens to come first — a link literally labeled "Brochure"
    pointed at Canva there, while "Website" pointed at the company's own
    domain and actually works. Only falls back to a low-trust candidate
    when every candidate in the row is one — still better than nothing."""
