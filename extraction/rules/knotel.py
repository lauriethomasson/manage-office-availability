"""Rule-based parser for Knotel's "Availability" email layout.

Layout (as plain text, one item per line):
    AREA HEADER (all caps, e.g. "CITY", "WEST END")
    Building name                      <- only present for the first floor
    Full address, London POSTCODE      <- of a given building
    Available[ from <date>]
    London
    Floor descriptor
    Full address, London POSTCODE      (repeated)
    [View property] [Download Floorplan] [View Brochure] [View Listing]  (buttons, order varies)
    Seats
    <n>
    Size
    <n> sqft
    Price (monthly)
    £<n> pcm
    Price (per sqft)
    £<n> per sqft

A building with multiple floors repeats from "Available" onward without
repeating the name/address lines.

Contacts is a fixed, whole-email value (_contact_block) — Knotel gives no
individual broker name, only a shared team contact in the intro
paragraph. Special Features carries a per-floor price-drop note when the
intro also flags one (_price_drop_notes) — otherwise blank. Brochure PDF
prefers a real, working knotel.com link ("View property"/"View Listing")
over "View Brochure" itself (_best_brochure_link) — confirmed real
(2026-07) that "View Brochure" always points at pitch.com, a JS-rendered
viewer that returns an HTML page when fetched directly, never real PDF
bytes, the same already-confirmed-unusable class as Canva/Box.com seen
elsewhere in this project. Distinct from Link to File, which app.py
always overwrites with the persisted source file link regardless of
what this rule sets.
