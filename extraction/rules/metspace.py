    """Fills Floor Plan from the source email's own per-listing image — a
    real, hosted mcusercontent.com image (MetSpace's own images have no
    distinguishing alt text, unlike Knotel's "X Floor featured image"
    convention, so this filters by source domain and excludes the "Logo"-
    alt company logo instead).

    Also fills Brochure PDF from that same matched link's own href — each
    building name in this source (e.g. "9-10 Market Place") is itself the
    hyperlink, not a separate "View Brochure"-style button the way Knotel's
    are. The href is a Mailchimp click-tracking redirect
    (us.list-manage.com/...), not a direct PDF URL — confirmed (2026-07)
    by actually following one all the way through: it 302s to a Google
    Drive file literally titled "9-10 Market Place - 2nd Floor", a real,
    listing-specific brochure. Kept as the tracking URL as extracted
    (not resolved to the final Drive link) — it works identically when
    clicked, and resolving it here would mean an extra network request
    per listing during extraction.

    Confirmed by actually viewing several of these images that every one
    is a floor plan diagram, not a building photo. Goes into Floor Plan,
    not High Res Images, for that reason; High Res Images is deliberately
    left blank for MetSpace since no second, genuinely-photo image exists
    per listing in this source.

    Direction confirmed directly against this source's raw HTML (not
    inherited from Knotel or GPE): each image FOLLOWS the listing link it
    belongs to, not precedes it — e.g. "9-10 Market Place"'s own link is
    immediately followed by its image, then "43-45 Charlotte Street"'s
    link, then its own image, and so on. An earlier version of this
    function assumed the opposite direction (image precedes link, mirrored
    from Knotel's pattern) — that assumption was wrong for MetSpace and
    silently shifted every image onto the *next* record instead of its
    own, including leaving the first listing incorrectly blank (it does
    have a real image; it had been misattributed to the second listing).

    Still not a simple positional pairing — a non-matching, non-image item
    (e.g. a blank spacer link, or the footer's phone/email links right
    after the last real listing) can sit between a link and its image, or
    can mark that no image exists for a given listing at all. So this only
    consumes an image for the record whose own link was *just* seen, and
    stops looking for that record's image (leaving it blank) the moment
    another non-blank link shows up first — never assumed from
    position/count alone."""
