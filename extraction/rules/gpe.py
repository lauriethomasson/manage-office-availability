def _photo_by_building(content, building_names):
    """Maps each building name to its real marketing photo(s) — genuine
    hosted assets-gbr.mkt.dynamics.com images (GPE's own images have no
    distinguishing alt text, same situation as MetSpace, so this filters
    by source domain instead), keyed by building rather than by
    occurrence: confirmed empirically GPE's email links each building's
    name exactly once in the "CURRENT AVAILABILITY" section, not once
    per floor/unit row the way MetSpace's does — so every floor of the
    same building shares the same candidate photo(s), applied by name
    lookup below rather than by sequential position.

    A building can genuinely have TWO distinct real photos, not one:
    confirmed by actually viewing them (not assumed) that a building
    also featured in the promotional/news blurbs at the top of the email
    (before "CURRENT AVAILABILITY") has its own separate photo there,
    different from its "CURRENT AVAILABILITY" listing-card photo — e.g.
    Thirty One Alfred Place has a ground-floor lounge shot in its promo
    blurb and a rooftop terrace shot in its listing card; Elsley has an
    outdoor courtyard shot in its promo blurb and an interior lounge shot
    in its listing card. Neither photo is tied to a *specific floor* of
    the building (this source has no per-floor photos at all, unlike
    MetSpace/Knotel) — they're both building-level, just from two
    different parts of the same email, so all floors of a building with
    two photos share the same two-item candidate list; app.py turns 2+
    candidates into a small gallery page (see _finalize_high_res_images).

    The two sections use opposite DOM ordering, confirmed by direct
    inspection: the "CURRENT AVAILABILITY" listing-card section is
    LINK-then-IMAGE (a building's own name link, then its photo,
    established after an earlier version of this function had the
    direction backwards and silently shifted every building's photo
    onto the next building's name); the promotional section is
    TEXT-then-IMAGE-then-CTA (a building's name appears in a heading/
    description, its photo follows, then a shared "Find out more"/"Read
    the full story" button — with no per-building link to key off at
    all, since 2-3 buildings can share one CTA). This finds the listing-
    card photo via the established link-adjacency method, and separately
    scans only the promo region (bounded to everything before the first
    listing-card link, so it can't cross into and misread that section)
    for each building's own nearby photo, searching a few positions in
    either direction in a unified text+image sequence (BeautifulSoup's
    own document-order traversal, so mid-word line-wrapping in the raw
    HTML — e.g. "16\\n Dufour's Place" — can't break a plain substring
    search the way it would against the raw HTML string directly)."""

    sometimes hard-wrapped across two lines, e.g. "+44 (0) 7435 9" then
    "39 956" — a source formatting quirk), terminated by "View in

    Pulls the phone number into Contacts alongside each name — confirmed
    (2026-07 audit) this was being silently dropped even though the
    source gives a real phone for every contact, the same class of gap
    Knotel's own missing contact info turned out to be. Collects every
    line between one name and the next (rather than assuming exactly one
    phone line) and joins them with NO separator before extracting the
    phone number, so a wrapped number like "+44 (0) 7435 9" / "39 956"
    reassembles into a normal-looking "+44 (0) 7435 939 956" — confirmed
    against the one real wrapped example seen so far, but this join
    convention (no separator) is an assumption, not verified against a
    second wrapped case; double check if a future contact's phone number
    ever looks wrong. names_only (extraction.schema) already strips
    phone numbers back out for Assigned Agents, same as it does for
    Knotel's own combined Contacts string, so this doesn't need any
