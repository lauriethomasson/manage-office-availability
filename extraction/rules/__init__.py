"""Rule-based parsers, one per known sender/layout.

Each module exposes:
  detect(content) -> bool        cheap check: does this look like our layout?
  parse(content) -> list[dict]   raw records (pre-normalization). Should not
                                  raise for minor per-row issues; skip the row.

The pipeline tries each rule's detect() in order and uses the first match's
parse(). If none match, it falls back to the LLM.
